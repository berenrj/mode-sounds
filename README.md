# mode-sounds

I created this page as a tool for musicians, and anyone with an interest to "hear the sounds of the modes".

Instrument selection is available between Guitar (default) and Piano.

Using the selected root note, each mode formula can be expanded/collapsed as desired, showing the information for the intervals present in the mode formula.

Based on the selected root note, each mode formula populates with the correct notes, triads and extended chords, which when clicked, will play the associated note or chord of each degree. Information for the formula (in relation to the major mode) and function (see 'roman numeral analysis' in music theory) is also shown.

I hope this can aid those interested in understanding modes and mode formulas, and help musicians to unlock their creativity when writing!
